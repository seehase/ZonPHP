# ZonPHP
## PHP Solar Logger

Based on the version from Slaper and Rally 
I decided to build an new version without Adobe FLASH so it can be used 
on mobiles and tablets as well.

I replaced all charts with new JavaScript charts using http://www.highcharts.com/ 
and refactored the PHP code to support PHP8.
