# ZonPHP
## PHP Solar Logger

based on the version from slaper and Rally 
I decided to build an new version without Adobe FLASH so it can be uses 
on mobiles and tablets as well.

So I replaced all charts with a new JavaScript charts using http://www.highcharts.com/ 
and refactored the PHP code and support PHP8.
